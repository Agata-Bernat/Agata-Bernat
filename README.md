### Hello World? Hello Tech World! <br>
### Hi there is me Agata 👋

I am fresh fullstack software developer from Germany. Last year I spend on learning JavaScript and really long list of stuff to start my journey in this field. Recently I graduate by creating with my team a website for a company (It was our Final Project). Now it is time to go forward. 
I am currently:
- 🔭 working on a few ideas/projects, that I would like to see "live".
- 🌱 learning new tools, that can help me create better websites in JavaScript. 
<br>
Let's code the world together... 😉
